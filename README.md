# **Treasurecodex**  
*A Blockchain-Based Crypto Scavenger Hunt Smart Contract*  

## **Overview**  
Treasurecodex is a decentralized smart contract built in Clarity that enables a **blockchain-based scavenger hunt**. Players solve progressively challenging puzzles to unlock rewards in STX tokens. Each puzzle (or stage) has a clue, a solution, and a prize. Players compete to solve stages, with prizes distributed automatically upon successful completion.  

### **Features**  
- **Admin-Managed Hunts**: The admin initializes and manages the scavenger hunt by adding stages with clues, solutions, unlock times, and prizes.  
- **Player Registration**: Players register by paying an entry fee to participate in the hunt.  
- **Progressive Puzzles**: Stages unlock sequentially, with each stage requiring a correct solution to proceed to the next.  
- **Prize Distribution**: Winners are awarded STX tokens for each solved stage, and a leaderboard is maintained for each stage.  
- **Time-Locked Clues**: Clues for each stage are only revealed after a specified block height.

## **Contract Flow**  

1. **Initialization**:  
   The admin initializes the hunt using the `initialize-hunt` function to set the contract to an active state and reset the current stage to zero.

2. **Adding Stages**:  
   The admin adds new stages with clues, hashed solutions, unlock heights, and prize amounts using the `add-stage` function.

3. **Player Registration**:  
   Players register for the hunt by calling the `register-player` function and paying the entry fee.

4. **Submitting Solutions**:  
   Players submit their solution to a stage using the `submit-solution` function. If correct, they:
   - Unlock the next stage.
   - Receive the prize associated with the solved stage.
   - Have their solution recorded on the leaderboard.

5. **Leaderboard and Player Progress**:  
   Players can view their progress and solved stages, while spectators can view the leaderboard for each stage.

## **Key Components**  

### **Data Structures**  

- **`hunt-stages`**:  
  A map that stores information about each stage, including:  
  - `clue`: The puzzle or hint for the stage.  
  - `encrypted-solution`: A hash of the correct solution.  
  - `unlock-height`: The block height after which the stage becomes available.  
  - `prize`: The reward for solving the stage.  
  - `solved`: A boolean indicating whether the stage has been solved.

- **`player-progress`**:  
  Tracks player progress, including:  
  - `current-stage`: The current stage the player is attempting to solve.  
  - `solved-stages`: A list of all stages solved by the player.  
  - `last-attempt`: The block height of the player's last solution attempt.  
  - `total-solved`: The total number of stages solved by the player.

- **`stage-solutions`**:  
  Records solution attempts and successful solutions for each stage by each player.

- **`stage-winners`**:  
  Maintains a leaderboard of the top 10 players who solved each stage, along with the block height at which they solved it.
